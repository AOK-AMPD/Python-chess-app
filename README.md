Welcome to my simple project. This is a simple version of chess coded entirely in python using the 'Pygame' Library that is used to make various games.

When downloading the zip file, first uncompress the zip file and then open 'chess_app.py' and run the file and the program should open!

You will have to edit the location of the images of the chess pieces as per your system.
First copy the PATH of all the images and replace the destinations with the new ones that reflect where you have installed the program
